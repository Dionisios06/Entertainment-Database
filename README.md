# What Is EntDb?
Entertainment Database *(or EntDb for short)* is a tool to track the **movies** & **shows** you have watched, the **games** you have played, the **books** & **comics** you have read & all the other stuff you have not yet got the chance to experience, all in 1 place.
# Why Use EntDb?
Unlike places like **IMDb**, **Goodreads**, **MyAnimeList** & all the others, it is built with a simple *-almost minimalistic-* UI with only the most important pieces of information; that being:
- **Status**: if you have engaged with the piece of media or not.
- **Franchise**: if its story is connected to other pieces of media.
- **Year**: in what year it released.
- **Name**: what it is called.
- **Media**: if it is a movie, game, book or something else.
- **Creator**: who is the person that directed it.
- **Company**: what companies are its distributor or copyright holder at the time of release.
- **IITF** *(importance in the franchise)*: a 5 tier system that tells you how important it is to consume it if you are invested in the franchise it belongs to.
- **Quantity**: how many episodes, chapters etc. it has.
- **Ranking**: your rating & review of it.

# Will ___ Category Be Added In The Future?
- Music (Albums)
Definitely, but not yet.
- Music (Standalones)
There's a 50% chance, but I'd need to first make some rules as to what whould be allowed since songs are one of the 2 easiest media to make.
- Paintings
Probably not, like songs they are one of the 2 easiest media to make & technically all you have to do is just look at it for a second or 2 to be done with it.
- Porn
It's already allowed, just not a priority for obvious reasons & not laboled because it would hault productivity.
- Episodes
I genuinely don't know, having you be able to review the episodes separately from the whole season would be great, but I'd be very difficult to aproach it.
- Software (Photoshop, VS Code, etc.)
Probably not, they're tools more than anything.
- Trailers
If a trailer is structured more like a short film with a unique plot, then it **might** be added in as that.
- Advertisements
It would be very complicated to make guidelines on which ones to allow, so the chance of that is tiny.
