# What Is EntDb?
Entertainment Database *(or EntDb for short)* is a tool to track the **movies** & **shows** you have watched, the **games** you have played, the **books** & **comics** you have read & all the other stuff you have not yet got the chance to experience, all in 1 place.
# Why Use EntDb?
Unlike places like **IMDb**, **Goodreads**, **MyAnimeList** & all the others, it is built with a simple *-almost minimalistic-* UI with only the most important pieces of information; that being:
- **Status**: if you have engaged with the piece of media or not.
- **Franchise**: if its story is connected to other pieces of media.
- **Year**: in what year it released.
- **Name**: what it is called.
- **Media**: if it is a movie, game, book or something else.
- **Creator**: who is the person that directed it.
- **Company**: what companies are its distributor or copyright holder at the time of release.
- **IITF** *(importance in the franchise)*: a 5 tier system that tells you how important it is to consume it if you are invested in the franchise it belongs to.
- **Quantity**: how many episodes, chapters etc. it has.
- **Ranking**: your rating & review of it.
